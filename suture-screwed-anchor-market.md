<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Screwed Anchor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The suture screwed anchor market is categorized into absorbable and non-absorbable types. Absorbable anchors are designed to degrade over time in the body, eliminating the need for subsequent removal and reducing long-term foreign body presence. These are often used in soft tissue repairs where temporary support is sufficient. Non-absorbable anchors, on the other hand, provide permanent fixation and are typically composed of materials like titanium or stainless steel, making them suitable for more robust structural applications in orthopedic and sports medicine procedures.</p></p>
