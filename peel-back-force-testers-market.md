<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peel Back Force Testers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Tester</li><li>Horizontal Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peel back force testers are specialized devices designed to measure the force required to peel or separate adhesive materials from surfaces. The market features two main types: vertical testers and horizontal testers. Vertical testers apply force in an upward or downward direction, simulating real-world applications like labels or tape on vertical surfaces. Horizontal testers, on the other hand, operate parallel to the ground, ideal for testing materials that lie flat, such as films or sheets. Both types ensure precise measurement and quality control in adhesive applications.</p></p>
