<p><h1>Bare Metal Stent Market Research Report Reveals The Latest Trends And Opportunities of this Market for Period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Bare Metal Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A bare metal stent (BMS) is a cylindrical device made of metal that is used to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries during angioplasty procedures. Unlike drug-eluting stents, bare metal stents do not have a polymer coating or medication to help prevent restenosisâ€”re-narrowing of the artery after the procedure. They offer immediate and straightforward mechanical support, making them suitable for various clinical situations, especially where patients have a lower risk of restenosis.</p><p>The Bare Metal Stent Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.1% during the forecast period. This market growth is driven by an increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, rising geriatric populations, and advancements in stent technology. Additionally, the growing awareness of minimally invasive procedures is further propelling the market. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards hybrid stenting techniques, wherein BMS is used in combination with drug-eluting stents to optimize patient outcomes. Furthermore, innovations in stent materials and design enhancements are also contributing to the market's expansion, as healthcare providers seek to improve safety and efficacy in treating coronary artery disease.</p></p>
