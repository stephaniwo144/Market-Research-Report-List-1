<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRP Grating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Molded FRP Grating</li><li>Pultruded FRP Grating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FRP grating market consists of two main types: molded FRP grating and pultruded FRP grating. Molded FRP grating is produced by using a casting process, providing a high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, making it ideal for various industrial applications. Pultruded FRP grating, on the other hand, is manufactured by pulling resin-soaked fiberglass through a heated die, resulting in a more uniform strength and profile, suitable for structural applications where load-bearing capacity is crucial.</p></p>
