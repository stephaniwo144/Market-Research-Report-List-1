<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Valved Implants</li><li>Nonvalved Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Glaucoma Drainage Devices market includes two main types: Valved Implants and Nonvalved Implants. Valved implants feature a pressure-sensitive mechanism that regulates fluid drainage, preventing excessive outflow and reducing complications like hypotony. Nonvalved implants lack this mechanism, relying on alternative methods to control fluid flow, often requiring additional surgical adjustments. Both types aim to manage intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients, with valved implants offering more predictable outcomes, while nonvalved implants may be preferred in specific clinical scenarios.</p></p>
